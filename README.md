# Tic Tac Toe Game
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic [Tic Tac Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game in ReactJS. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where players take turns placing their symbol (either 'X' or 'O') in an empty cell. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Once the installation is complete, run the following command to start the development server:

```
npm start
```
The game should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## How to Play
The game is played between two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

To make a move, simply click on an empty cell on the grid. The first player to make a move is X, and the second player is O. The game ends when either one of the players wins, or the game ends in a tie.
